## React Assignment

1. How can you implement shared functionality across a component tree?
### This can be done using several techniques. These methods allow us to manage state, actions, or logic that needs to be accessible by multiple components. we can do this with these some techniques =>
 <br/>  Context API => this is great for sharing state and functions across a component tree without deeply nested prop drilling.
  <br/> HOCs => these are useful for injecting additional props or logic into components.
  <br/> Custom Hooks => these are perfect for reusing logic across components in a clean and modular way.
 <br/> State Management Libraries => thesde are ideal for managing complex state and logic in large applications.

2. Why is the `useState` hook appropriate for handling state in a complex component?
### The useState hook is appropriate for handling state in complex components due to its simplicity, flexibility, and the ability to keep state logic encapsulated within components. It enables us to manage state effectively without needing to rely on more complex state management solutions unless necessary. For many use cases, especially in functional components, useState provides a powerful and straightforward way to handle state.


3. Design a user interface resembling the provided page. Fetch the data from the server and dynamically map the information cards to the fetched data. Ensure that the search functionality is also implemented.
